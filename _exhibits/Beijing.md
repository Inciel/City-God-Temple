name: Beijing City God Temple
introduction: The Temple of the City God is dedicated to the City God, the deity who guards the city of Beijing. There are three gates on the central axis (Temple Gate, Shun Tak Gate and Hsuan Wei Gate), as well as the Bell and Drum Tower, the Great Wei Ling Temple and the Dormitory, the two halls and the animal treatment house, the excellent pavilion, the prairie stove and the stele pavilion. Five rooms of the ancestral hall now exist. Inside the temple are the Ming Yingzong Monument and the Qing Shizong and Gaozong Monuments. There are inscriptions by the Kangxi Emperor and the Yongzheng Emperor. Later, with the demolition and planning of the Financial Street, the temple has survived in name only. The Du City God Temple Fair is one of Beijing's earliest and most lively temple fairs. The market is held on the first, fifteenth and twenty-fifth day of each month in the old calendar. On the opening day of the market, traders gather the things people use every day and a collection of favorite products from all over the country, such as Su embroidery, Shu brocade, silk, ink, and rice paper, as well as domestic and foreign exotic treasures. Merchants come from the four corners of the country and from abroad.

site: 33 Chengfang Street, Xicheng District
story: In 1875 (the early year of Guangxu), the City God Temple was destroyed by fire. The halls were all in ruins, the so-called city god statues of the provinces were damaged, and even the stone monuments were cracked. At the end of the Guangxu period, only three main halls were restored for spring and autumn worship. In the early years of the Republic of China, the temple was still very popular, and there were people making wishes and returning wishes for various reasons. Some people tied their arms under the elbows and tied them to a stove to make a pilgrimage; some boys "lowered" their value by putting on red clothes, red trousers, heavy powder and two tiny buns, dressed as girls, and came to pay their respects one step at a time or three steps at a time. Although there were believers and incense, the temple fair was no longer held. As society developed, the temple fair at the Capital City God Temple gradually declined and was replaced at the Guoguo Temple in Guang'anmen.
