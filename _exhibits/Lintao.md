The most prominent building in the front courtyard is the temple's main hall, with its high eaves and intricately carved ridge, which is so impressive that men and women often come to burn incense and worship. The central courtyard is a small courtyard; north of the temple is the second temple, the scale is much smaller than the main hall. The main and second halls divide the courtyard into a one-acre square, with two rows of compartments in the east and west and a water well in the yard.
