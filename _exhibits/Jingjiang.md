story: In 1471, the emperor in Beijing sent a governor called Zhaozhengtao, a native of Henan to Jingjiang county. Three years later, he died of drowning while leading a water control project. Afterwards, the emperor posthumously awarded him the title of "Marquis of Ling Ying, Minister of Water". To commemorate him, the people of Jingjiang built the earliest City God Temple in Jingjiang, which was established as a temple for the town, and the people affectionately called him 'City God Master'. This temple is very solemn and majestic and has a history of over 500 years.
