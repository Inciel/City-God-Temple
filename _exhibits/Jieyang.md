Sister-in-law said ‘You can marry the City God!’ Hearing this, Song just laughed and did not say anything. That night, Song did see the City God come to her boudoir and sleep with her. She tied a red rope on the foot of the city god. The next morning, she told her sister-in-law the dream. In the daytime, the girl went to the city god temple again, and indeed saw the red rope her dream tied to on the foot of the city god. Later, the girl died without illness, people said she was married to the city god as a wife.
