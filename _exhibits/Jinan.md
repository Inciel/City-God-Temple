story: The story about this city god is the "Sunshine City God". It is said that whenever there was a severe drought, the county government of Licheng would organise a visit to the County City God Temple to pray for rain. After worshipping the god, they would invite him down from his throne and carry him to the courtyard to dry in the sun, and only when it rained would the god be returned to his throne, meaning "no dinner until you finish your work". This is the custom of the old Jinan people to "sunbathe the City God". Every year, a ceremony is held on the Qingming Festival, the 15th day of the seventh month and the first day of the tenth month. The people carry the county city god to the General City God Temple on General Temple Street to meet with the city gods of Jinan Prefecture and other states and counties and then march into the Governor's City God Temple on Donghua Street to meet with the Governor, which is a spectacular and lively scene.
