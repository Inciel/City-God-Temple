introduction: City God is a god of Chinese religious beliefs and Taoist beliefs to guard the city. Wugong City God Temple was built in the Northern Zhou Dynasty, and was repaired in the Tang and Song Dynasties. It was rebuilt during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty and rebuilt during the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods. The structure is unique to the Ming Dynasty architectural style and is a complete group of ancient buildings with history, characters, culture, and legends. It was named the Capital City God temple because of its historical and strange relationship with Li Shimin, Emperor Taizong of Tang Dynasty.

story: According to the legend, Emperor Taizong Li Shimin was dreaming of a trip to hell when he was confronted with a river of blood and evil spirits demanding his life, and he was terrified to wade through it. Before he could thank him, he had already left. Taizong woke up in a cold sweat and was very grateful to the man who had saved him. Later, when Li Shimin returned to Wugong, he saw the statue of the city god, which looked exactly like the man in his dream, and suddenly realised that it was this countryman who had helped him. Consequently, the people took the city god as the spokesman of this divine emperor, and asked him to bless them in case of drought or flood, old age, sickness, death, lawsuits, or promotion in examinations.
