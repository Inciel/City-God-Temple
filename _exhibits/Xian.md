story: The Xi'an City God Temple is dedicated to Ji Xin, a great general under Emperor Liu Bang during the Han Dynasty. He was captured by the army from another country for saving Liu Bang from being trapped in Xingyang and was burnt to death by his enemy in his anger. After Liu Bang became emperor, he rewarded him posthumously and gave him a yellow robe. He chose a place where he could rest from hunting and built a large temple to worship him, which later became a temple fair. It is said that during the reign of the two emperors, in response to the wishes of the people and to strengthen their rule, the god was worshipped as the god of the city and became the protector of Chang'an city.
