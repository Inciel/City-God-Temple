story: It is dedicated to Zhou Cao, a loyal and martyr figure of the Han Dynasty. Zhou Cao was the royal official of Liu Bang, the ancestor of the Han Dynasty, who defended the city of Xingyang. When Xiang Yu captured the city, Zhou Cao was captured, and Xiang Yu wanted to make him a general and enjoy the title of ten thousand family members. When Xiang Yu captured the city, Zhou Cao was captured, and Xiang Yu wanted to make him a general and enjoy the title of ten thousand household officials. In addition, the Fujian City God Temple is also attached to many famous officials and sages of the Qing Dynasty. For example, Fan Gong, the Guanglu Daifu of the Tang Dynasty, Liu Changzu, who assisted Wang Zhaizhi in the Five Dynasties, Cai Xiang, who was the governor of Fuzhou in the Song Dynasty, Lu Guang, the defender of Youxi in the Southern Tang Dynasty, Dong Yuan Bing, the lieutenant of the Yuan Dynasty, and Tang He, who led the army into Fuzhou in the Ming Dynasty and defeated the Yuan army and saved the city of Fuzhou. This shows that it is very relevant for the people of Fuzhou to erect a plaque in the City God Temple for those officials who have outstanding achievements in guarding Fuzhou City and building Fuzhou City over the generations to show that they will always be remembered.
