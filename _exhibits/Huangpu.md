Qin Yubo resigned to return to his hometown laterly. Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang found himself lacking in culture and wisdom, so he was determined to promote a high-ranking Yuan court official from the Shanghai region, who could both assist him and satisfy the local people, and ward off the danger of evil spirits. In order to enlist the famous gentry of Jiangnan, he placed Qin Yubo high on a shrine, giving the world much spiritual comfort and support.
