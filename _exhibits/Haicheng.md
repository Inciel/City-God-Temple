story: In 1471 (the seventh year of the Ming Dynasty's Chenghua era) the Ming dynasty set up Jingjiang County, and the emperor in Beijing sent a governor (equivalent to the current municipal party secretary) called Zhaozhengtao, a native of Henan, who unfortunately drowned three years later while leading a water control effort. "After the festival, various gods of plague ride on the paper boats made of coloured paper by the people, with candle lanterns in them, which are lit and float away down the river, the river is lit up like daylight, a very spectacular scene. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties and the Republic of China, there were often epidemics among the people of Haicheng, so the folklore of welcoming the city god to get rid of the plague gods was very prevalent.
