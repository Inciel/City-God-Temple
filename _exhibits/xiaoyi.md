In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the county business association commissioned Hou Youcheng to refurbish and restore the original appearance, with a total of more than 3,000 silver yuan. In February 27th of the Republic of China, Le Lou was hit by Japanese shells and was destroyed. During the Liberation War, Yan Xishan's army dismantled the City God Temple to repair bunkers and build fortifications. After the liberation, only a dozen decrepit main halls and side halls remained in the Chenghuang Temple, and the music building was in a dilapidated state. In 1952, Xiaoyi Middle School converted it into a dormitory and a storehouse, and in 1958, when a new school site was built, the theatre building was completely demolished.
